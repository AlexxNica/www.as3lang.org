===============

build a community web site about AS3 with AS3  
for the people  
for the community  
for the language  


sure, it starts slow with a simple "hello world"  
but if you follow the evolution of the source code  
during the next few weeks  
you will learn and see  
all the things that AS3 can do server side  
and maybe get inspired to build your own web site using AS3 :)ï»¿  


Why AS3lang ?
-------------

Here what we know
  - **AS1** JS like
  - **AS2** TypeScript/Dart/CoffeeScript like
  - **AS3** great or good enough
  - **AS4** will not happen

So yeah ActionScript 3.0 is what it is all about, but what else ?

Some people will tell you that AS3 is Flash and that "Flash is dead",
wether those people are haters, trolls or simply misinformed, one thing
is sure, "I think what we have here is a communication problem".

Unless you can sit with someone for few minutes and explain all the
differences between Flash as the Flash Player plugin for browsers,
Flash as the Flash Platform, FLash as the Adobe Flash CC IDE, etc.
it is just so easy to confuse anyone about it.

And it's nothing new, we already had the very same communication problem
with Flex: from Flex Builder the IDE, passing by the Flex SDK,
to the Flex framework, etc. you throw MXML in the lot and then rename
the whole thing to Apache Flex and then boom everyone is confused.

One possible alternative, or solution, is to simply talk about all that
from the programming language point of view.


ActionScript 3.0
----------------

#### What is it ?

A programming language


#### What can we do with it ?

Build software in large sense of the term.


#### Do I need to compile it ?

Yes, AS3 is in gneeral compiled to bytecode and executed by a runtime.


#### What compilers are available ?

There are open source and commercial compilers.

The Apache Flex project provide open source compilers that you can find in the Apache Flex SDK.

Adobe provide 2 commercial compilers:
  - Adobe Flash CC (not free)
  - AIR SDK (free)


#### What runtimes are available ?

You have the Flash Player, a browser plugin which allow to execute SWF file embedded in HTML.

You have AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime), with it you can publish executable for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux desktop, and you can also publish native mobile applications for iOS and Android.

You have also the open source project Redtamarin, those runtimes allow to produce command line executable,
server side programs and shell scripts that can run on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

You can also find third party commercial runtimes like Scaleform GFX, which allow to publish on console like Xbox and PlayStation, and as well on mobile for iOS and Android.
